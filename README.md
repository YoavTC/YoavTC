Hello! 👋 My name is Yoav!
========================

I've been writing code since 2020 and making games in Unity since 2022. I love creating experiences for people, whether that be through hosting events on my old Minecraft server, or making a multiplayer party games just for me and my friends to enjoy. Seeing other people having fun because of something I did is what drives me.

* 🌍  I'm live in Israel, Tel-Aviv 🇮🇱, and willing to relocate to Europe 🇪🇺 or North America  🇺🇸 🇨🇦
* 🗣️  I speak Hebrew & English fluently, and willing to learn more!
* 📖  I am currently studying Game Development in the Open University of Israel, Hasifa.

C# Unity Programmer
-----------------------
> Check out my pinned repositories to see my best code!

I have over 2 years of experience working with Unity 2D and 3D. I have made both mobile and PC desktop games, and want to learn more about VR and Web development in the future.

I have a strong understanding of the Unity engine and how it works, and a <i>slight</i> obsession with always finding new tools to streamline and optimize my workflow on it ([Check this out](https://yoavtc.github.io/top-tier-free-tools/)).

Game Designer
-----------------------
Between 2020-2021, I had a Minecraft server with MMO-RPG mechanics and themes. I created the quests, achievements, boss fights, events, lore and much more. [I have an entire page on it on my website](https://yoavtc.work/projects/minecraft-server.html).

Sometimes in my spare time, I like to make YouTube videos on video game mechanics and how I would approach either balancing or changing them.
